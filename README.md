I developed a comprehensive annotation tool leveraging advanced JavaScript libraries like Konva.js and TLDraw. Konva.js provided robust support for 2D canvas rendering, allowing us to implement intricate drawing functionalities and interactive features. TLDraw facilitated the creation of user-friendly, intuitive interfaces for annotation, ensuring a seamless and efficient user experience. This combination enabled me to build a powerful tool capable of handling complex annotation tasks with precision and ease.
